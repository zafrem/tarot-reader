### ðŸ”® Tarot Reading Usage

#### Basic Tarot Readings

# Single card draw
card = draw_single()
print(f"{card['name']} - {card['meaning']}")

# 3-Card spread (Past/Present/Future)
reading = draw_three()
for position, card in reading.items():
    print(f"{position}: {card['name']} - {card['meaning']}")

reading = celtic_cross()
for position, card in reading.items():
    print(f"{position}: {card['name']} - {card['meaning']}")
```

#### Personal Context (Time-Influenced Randomness)
```python
# Personal info influences but doesn't determine results
personal_info = "INFP seeking career guidance"

card1 = draw_single(personal_info)
card2 = draw_single(personal_info)  # Different from card1 due to time component

# Different personal info = different results
reading_a = draw_three("ENFJ + A+ blood type")
reading_b = draw_three("ISTJ + relationship questions")
```

```python
from src import get_single_card_text, get_random_cards_text

# Beautiful terminal display
card_display = get_single_card_text()
# Returns: "ðŸŽ´ Strength\n   â†³ Courage, persuasion, influence, compassion"

# Multiple cards with formatting
cards_display = get_random_cards_text(3)
# Returns formatted multi-card display with headers and numbering

# Extract just the meanings for simple use
